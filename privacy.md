# Privacy

This extension runs entirely in your browser. It deletes the thumbs up/down feedback buttons on ChatGPT pages and stops there.

- No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
- No network requests are made beyond what ChatGPT already does.
- All logic stays on-device; nothing is logged or shared.

If you have questions or spot a bug, open an issue on the repository.***
